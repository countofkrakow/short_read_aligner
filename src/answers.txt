1. Yes. Not only are there more accepted alignments, but there is also more variety in the misaligned nucleotides.
   This is likely because the HIV virus has had more time to replicate its genome after the 6th visit as compared to the 1st visit,
   meaning that a larger portion of the reads in v6 are made up of HIV dna. Because of the higher number of accepted reads,
   there are also a higher number of nucleotide mismatches within accepted reads, explaining the larger mismatch variety.

   In summary, the HIV has had more time to replicate and inject its dna into the patient's genome from v1 to v6, and
   thus ends up composing a larger portion of the patient's genome as time goes on.

2. No, there are some variants in v1 that are missing in v6:
